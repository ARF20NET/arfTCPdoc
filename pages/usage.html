<h2 class="text-primary">arfTCP: <small><i>Usage</i></small></h2>
<hr>
<p>Assuming you have installed and included the header, you are now ready to use the library.</p>
<p>Before doing anything, in any situation, you must first initialize the library, this is because how WinSock works and my implementation. Now we'll see different applications.</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">arf::TCPInit();</pre>
</div>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Single client server</h4>
<p>Next, you can instantiate the TCPServer class, making sure to provide valid arguments, and after that call is completed suscesfully,
    the socket will valid so you can perform Send() and Recv().</p>
<p>In this example a TCP server is created on every network interface, at port 8089. You can provide SockAddr (listen address and port) or just unsigned short (listen port) as argument.
    The second argument is a user defined error handling function, to let the user how to proceed when a error occurs, we will explain that later.
    The call will block the program until a client attemps to connect, or a error occurs, in which case the library will call the function you passed as second argument.
    </p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">
arf::TCPServer server(arf::SockAddr(INADDR_ANY, 8089), ErrorHandler);
arf::TCPServer server(8089, ErrorHandler);</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, a connection is suscesfully stablished (otherwise if a error occurs the error handler should stop the execution) and you can start to send a receive data.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Client</h4>
<a href="/source/arfTCP/arfTCP/examples/client.cpp">Example</a>
<p>In the other end, instantiate TCPClient, passing the server IP address, and port. You can get a IP address for a host with arf::ResolveHost().
    As in the server constructor you must provide a error handler.</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">arf::TCPClient client(arf::SockAddr(arf::ResolveHost("arf20.com", errorHandler), 8089), errorHandler);</pre>
</div>
<p>This call will block until sucess, or fail. Under normal circumstances this should be practically instant.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Simple bidirecctional I/O methods</h4>
<p>Now that we have valid and active TCP connections, we can start to send a receive data throught the TCP stream. With Send() and Recv() methods respectively,
    both take a pointer to a sufficiently large buffer, and the exact size as second parameter. In Send(), the data is readed from the buffer and sent over the stream, and in Recv(),
    the program blocks until data is received, and then is written to the provided buffer. The third parameter, is as always, the error handler.</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">
char *buff = new char[1024];               // Sample buffer to read/write

client.Send(buff, 1024, ErrorHandler);     // Send buffer from client to server
client.Recv(buff, 1024, ErrorHandler);     // Receive buffer to client from server
server.Send(buff, 1024, ErrorHandler);     // Send buffer from server to client
server.Recv(buff, 1024, ErrorHandler);     // Receive buffer to server from client</pre>
</div>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Asynchronous receive loop with callback</h4>
<p>Introduced in 1.1, a receive loop was added. Now the user doesn't even have to implement it by itself! When data is received,
    the user receive handler is called, with the received data provided.</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">
bool RecvHandler(char *buff, size_t size); // Sample receive handler

client.StartRecvLoop(RecvHandler, ErrorHandler);</pre>
</div>
<p>The receive loop has a default buffer size of 65535 bytes, you can override this by defining BUFFSIZE, before including arfTCP.</p>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Multiclient server</h4>
<a href="/source/arfTCP/arfTCP/examples/multiclient_server.cpp">Example</a>
<p>The new release 1.2 has a multiclient server that fully implements a basic multiclient TCP server, including accept loop, and receive loop, in their respective asyncronous threads.
    This way the user doesnt have to implement anything by itself. But must provide a accept handler, this handler may be empty, its purpose is to provide a way to respond to a new connection,
    with a welcome message for example, or log it locally, etc. For that, a arf::TCPBase is provided for simple I/O methods, and the client address. The first parameter is the listening IP address and port, the second, the mentioned accept handler. The third parameter is again
    a handler, to handle received data, the user doesn't need to Recv() by itself, just respond to received data in this handler. The client address and received data is provided to the handler.
    The final parameter is the error handler, we'll see in the next section.
</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">
bool AcceptHandler(arf::TCPBase* io, arf::SockAddr addr); // Sample accept handler
bool RecvHandler(char *buff, size_t size);                // Sample receive handler

arf::TCPServerMulti server(arf::SockAddr(INADDR_ANY, 8089), AcceptHandler, RecvHandler, ErrorHandler);</pre>
</div>

<h4 class="text-secondary">Exception handling</h4>	
<p>The brand new way of reporting errors introduced in 1.4. Along with 1.4 a new class <i>arf::Exception</i> was introduced, it designates a error. So the user has to wrap every call in a try-catch block, with parameter <i>arf::Exception</i>.
Then in the catch block, the user has to handle the exception. To know what happend <i>arf::Exception</i> contains a member <i>e</i> that contains a error code, one of the listed in the <a href="http://arf20.com/arfTCPdoc/?page=reference.php&reference=e.html">reference</a>.
This makes the user having to handle only a single set of error codes, arfTCP converts WinSock and POSIX codes to his own set.</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">
try {
	// Whatever call
} catch (arf::Exception e) {
	std::cout << e.ToString();			// Print string of error provided by arf::Exception
	switch (e.e) {					// Switch error code
	case arf::Exception::CONNABORTED: {		// Handle each error separatedly or just print the error
		// Handle CONNABORTED
	} break;
	}
}</pre>
</div>


<h4 class="text-secondary">Error handling (deprecated since 1.4)</h4>
<p>The user must always handle errors. The error code depends (currently) in the underlaying API, in case of Windows, the error code correspends to WinSock2's errors,
look them up in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/windows-sockets-error-codes-2">this table</a>. In the case of POSIX, the error code will be the generic
Unix/Linux errno value, is not as complete as WinSock2, but still has useful information, in <a href="https://www-numi.fnal.gov/offline_software/srt_public_context/WebDocs/Errors/unix_system_errors.html">the table</a>.
The format of the error handler callback is the next:</p>
<div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-dark text-white">
    <pre style="margin: 0;" class="code">
void ErrorHandler(int err) {
	switch (err) {
	case 10061: {
		// Handle connection refused
	} break;
	}
}

[...]

... ...(..., ErrorHandler);</pre>
</div>
<p>Several ways to do this, for example just printing the error in stdout (please dont do that in a serious application), or the better way, displaying a MessageBox (pop up error message) displaying a human readable error to the user. Other ways would fit for specific applications.
This choose is left as an exercise for the developer.<p>
