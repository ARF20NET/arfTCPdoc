<h2 class="text-primary">arfTCP: <small><i>Simple TCP library</i></small></h2>
<hr>
<p>A simple and elegant TCP library for small projects, thought for ease of use so the coder can focus on the important stuff of
  his project without having to deal with the details of implementing TCP servers and clients using the famous for its difficulty, WinAPI WinSock.</p>
<p>For that very reason, I made this as a header only library, to further simplify the usage. Take in account that because of that,
  the header will include some dependencies, be careful.</p>
<h5>Features</h5>

  <li><span>Single client server</span></li>
